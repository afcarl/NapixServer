Installation
------------

Use ``python setup.py develop``. It will install the
required dependencies. If you want to install them
manually, look them up inside ``setup.py``.

Note: ``python setup.py install`` does not work yet,
because of the way we look up the location of static
files.


Configuration
-------------

The main configuration file is in ``conf/settings.json``.

Set the authentication URL in Napix.Auth/auth_url
and the service name (this server's hostname) in Napix.Auth/service.


Launching the application
-------------------------

bin/napixd

You can now connect to this server with the command line at localhost:8002
or use the web interface at http://localhost:8002/_napix_js/
