Managers actions
================


Napix allows to write quickly managers that can do CRUD operations.
Other operations can be written with actions.

Actions operate on a resource and are instance methods of a manager.
They can take parameters, mandatory or optional.

They are declared by the decorator :py:func:`managers.actions.action`.

For example, we will add a scan port action to the HostManager written in
:ref:`the high-level how-to<high_level>`.
